## üîß Usage 

- There is also a **config.js** file in the root directory of the project which contains configuration options for the template. You can customize it however you want to fit your needs.

- The **components directory** contains reusable components that are used throughout the template, such as the Button, Header, Layout, ProjectCard, and SkillCard components. These components can be customized or replaced as needed to fit your own design requirements.

- The **pages directory** contains the pages of the website, such as the index.js page for the home page, the about.js page for the "About Me" section, the contact.js page for the contact form, and the projects.js page for the projects section. You can add or remove pages as needed, or modify the existing pages to fit your own content.

- The **public directory** contains static assets, such as images and fonts, that are used throughout the template. You can add your own images or fonts to this directory and reference them in your components or pages.

- The **styles directory** contains the global styles for the template, as well as specific styles for individual components. The globals.css file contains the global styles, while the index.module.css file contains the styles for the index.js page. You can modify these styles or add your own styles to fit your own design requirements.

- The **utils directory** contains utility functions that are used throughout the template, such as the formatDate function for formatting dates and the sendEmail function for sending emails from the contact form. You can modify or add your own utility functions as needed.
